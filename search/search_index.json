Why Chern-Simons Terms? This will be a different sort of math gathering to discuss the following question: What are the mathematically expressible properties of so called \"Chern-Simons Terms\u201d which arise from differential geometry that might suggest why they are used in Physics discussions? This question was suggested by Jeff Cheeger whose work with Jim Simons lead to the first framework, \"Differential Characters\" (1970s) for the initial \"Chern-Simons term\" constructed by Simons. One motivation for this question is to aid the mathematically-minded to understand something related to physics . This, in terms of ideas mathematicians can formulate , understand and then use. The discussion might also benefit the physically-minded by illustrating the ways of basic thinking that help many mathematicians to potentially understand anything using mathematical concepts quite forcefully. The intended form of the gathering will be an open discussion front and center with a panel of mathematicians and physicists, with no lectures per se but perhaps a blackboard for brief explanations. There will be an interview of Jim conducted by Jean Pierre Bourguignon about the story of differential geometry question that started the discussion leading to the first \"Chern-Simons Terms\". There will also be a showing of a short ten minute film containing Jim reading the text of a fictional cosmology fantasy he wrote called \"The last three minutes.\" For registration, please click the following link: Panelists Physicists Zohar Komargodski (Simons Center for Geometry and Physics (SCGP)) {target=\" blank\"} Juan Maldacena (Institute for Advanced Study (IAS)) Nikita Nekrasov (SCGP) Edward Witten (IAS) (_to be confirmed ){target=\"_blank\"} Mathematicians Jean-Pierre Bourguignon (Former Director of IHES) Simon Donaldson (SCGP & Imperial College London) ( to be confirmed ){target=\"_blank\"} Alexander Kirillov (SUNY Stony Brook) Mahmoud Zeinalian (CUNY Graduate Center) Organizer Dennis Sullivan (CUNY Graduate Center & SUNY Stony Brook)","title":"Home"},{"location":"#discussion-of-chern-simons-terms-which-appear-frequently-in-the-action-principle-of-theoretical-physics-on-the-occasion-of-jim-simons-85th-birthday","text":"The Math-Physics meeting will be held on Tuesday, April 25, 2023 at the CUNY Graduate Center (5 th Ave. & 34 th St.) in the Skylight Conference Room (9 th floor), between 2:00pm - 5:00pm.","title":"Discussion of \"Chern-Simons Terms\" which Appear Frequently in the Action Principle of Theoretical Physics on the Occasion of Jim Simons' 85th Birthday"},{"location":"#why-chern-simons-terms","text":"This will be a different sort of math gathering to discuss the following question: What are the mathematically expressible properties of so called \"Chern-Simons Terms\u201d which arise from differential geometry that might suggest why they are used in Physics discussions?
